            <ul>
                <li>Every test is a measurement</li>

            <h3>Why the media ?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Media offer a public service</li>
                <li>In some countries Media are state funded</li>
                <li>The cut of population interacting with online media is the electing/working one, knowing their interest is sensitive for a foreign state</li>
                <li>Current business model totally unbalanced, and the future experiment scarier: journalist know that, can be compelled.</li>

            <h2>Contextual Analysis</h2>
            <p>Made experiment to tackle smaller group:</p>
            <i>Take the browser history of three community leaders and make that analysis</i>
            <br>
            <i>Choose a Twitter #hashtag and check all the link included where they bring and who's behind each one".</i>
            <p><b>Benefit</b>: much more concrete analysis, partnership and target</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. Classical one: “user vs companies” <small>tackling digital right to privacy, checking current legal standard and user self defense</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Political and social: “mass vs company”: <small>you can't relay on self defense, and you can measure how much of the population is predictable or influenciable by foreing service.</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. “user vs state”: <small>Classical like “1” but with different target of interest, can be used neat area of economic or geographic conflicts.</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. “state vs state”: <small>The geopolitical, is like 2 but can be interpolated with current and past state level agreements or conflict </small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    5. “state vs organization”: <small>can be used to tackle companies, NGO or group that are explicitly threaten by a state actor.</small>
