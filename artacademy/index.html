          <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
          <p>
              <b>Trackography is an observatory of the third party trackers in Internet websites;
                  The goal is raise awareness on trackers presence and implication. </b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Has not to be confunded with other tool, like Lightbean, Disconnect.me, Ghostery or
                  ADBlockPlus that monitor your personal navigation in order to display tracking.
              <br>
              These tools are useful for the user itself, while Trackography want study the global phenomena.

            <i>Choose a Twitter #hashtag and check all the link included where they bring and who's behind each one".</i>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. Classical one: “user vs companies” <small>tackling digital right to privacy, checking current legal standard and user self defense</small>

                <li>
                    2. Political and social: “mass vs company”: <small>you can't relay on self defense, and you can measure how much of the population is predictable or influenciable by foreing service.</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. “user vs state”: <small>Classical like “1” but with different target of interest, can be used neat area of economic or geographic conflicts.</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. “state vs state”: <small>The geopolitical, is like 2 but can be interpolated with current and past state level agreements or conflict </small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    5. “state vs organization”: <small>can be used to tackle companies, NGO or group that are explicitly threaten by a state actor.</small>
