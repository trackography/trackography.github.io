                    Why did we develop Trackography?
                </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>We are interested in the online tracking business because it is pretty opaque</li>
                    <li>We have seen through the Snowden revelations that tracking companies have gotten exploited by intelligence agencies</li>
                    <li>We do not control the profiles created about us by the online tracking business - which can lead to abuse</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>One of the most common things we do is read the news online</li>
                        <li>The business model of the media is largely dependent on advertising</li>
                        <li>The type of news we read show more about us in the long-term than what we think</li>
                        <li>The Facebook experiment shows that what we read influences our behaviour</li>

                    <h2>What do we mean by 'media'?</h2>
                    <p>
                       We mean websites which cover the news, are of public interest and which are regularly updated </p> 
<p> Every country has its own media websites which are visited by its citizens from that specific country
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We compiled lists of media websites for each country we examined and distinguished between global (e.g. theguardian.co.uk), national (covers the entire nation), regional (covers a region) media websites and blogs
                    </p>
                    <small>The creation of such media lists requires local knowledge - which is why need you to collaborate with us</small>

                        Largely conditional because in some cases:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Users can only opt-out if their browser is not configured to block third party cookies
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users can only opt-out by cancelling their account with a service
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users need to opt-out from every device that they use
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Users can only opt-out from the browser that they are using
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If users opt-out they will have restricted access to content, features and services
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ...and lets not forget the various default online tracking settings browsers have...
                        </li>
