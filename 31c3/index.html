                Why did we develop Trackography?
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We are interested in the online tracking business because it is pretty opaque</li>
                <li>We have seen through the Snowden revelations that intelligence agencies have tapped into the data collected by tracking companies</li>
                <li>We do not control the profiles created about us by online tracking companies - which can lead to abuse</li>
                <li>This is a project for advocacy and transparency</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Why are we focusing on media websites? </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the most common things we do is read the news online</li>
                    <li>The business model of the media is largely dependent on advertising</li>
                    <li>The type of news we read show more about us in the long-term than what we think</li>
                    <li>A Facebook experiment shows that what we read influences our behaviour</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>What do we mean by 'media'?</h2>
                <p>
                    We mean websites which cover the news, are of public interest and which are regularly updated </p>
                <p> Every country has its own media websites which are visited by individuals from that specific country
                </p>
                <p>
                    We compiled lists of media websites for each country we examined and distinguished between global (e.g. theguardian.co.uk), national (covers the entire nation), regional (covers a region) media websites and blogs
                </p>
                <small>The creation of such media lists requires local knowledge - which is why we need you to collaborate with us!</small>

            <h3>
                Developing a Script to Track the Trackers
            </h3>
            <p>
                Our script is designed to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Perform an HTTP connection (using phantomjs) to every media website under analysis
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collect all the third party URLs which are included in the media websites under analysis
                </li>
                <li>
                    Perform a traceroute for every URL included in the media websites under analysis
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identify the countries which host the network infrastructure and perform a GeoIP conversion of all the included IP addresses in the network path
                </li>
            </ul> <br>
        <small>But the script does NOT work in conjunction with your browser - it just performs a connection to the media and sends us the results</small>

                <p>
                    We collected the following fields of data from the privacy policies of some of the globally prevailing tracking companies:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The types of data they collect

                        Whether users can opt-out from their tracking

                    <li>
