          <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
          <p>
              <b>Trackography is an observatory of the third party trackers in Internet websites;
                  The goal is raise awareness on trackers presence and implication. </b>
              <br>
              <br>
              Has not to be confunded with other tool, like Lightbean, Disconnect.me, Ghostery or
                  ADBlockPlus that monitor your personal navigation in order to display tracking.
              These tools are useful for the user itself, while Trackography want study the global phenomena.

                        and correlate their behavior to a precise amount of person per nation
                        (<b>cost:</b> we have to map these companies)

                <ul>
                    <li>Media offer a public service</li>
                    <li>In some countries Media are state funded</li>
                    <li>The cut of population interacting with online media is the electing/working one, knowing their interest is sensitive for a foreign state</li>
                    <li>Current business model totally unbalanced, and the future experiment scarier: journalist know that, can be compelled.</li>

                <p>Made experiment to tackle smaller group:</p>
                <i>Take the browser history of three community leaders and make that analysis</i>
                <br>
                <i>Choose a Twitter #hashtag and check all the link included where they bring and who's behind each one".</i>
                <p><b>Benefit</b>: much more concrete analysis, partnership and target</p>

                    Corporate surveillance is creating unprotected collection of sensitive data, from the long term analysis of apparently meaningless information. These entities are able to describe in details everyone.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    1. Classical one: “user vs companies” <small>tackling digital right to privacy, checking current legal standard and user self defense</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Political and social: “mass vs company”: <small>you can't relay on self defense, and you can measure how much of the population is predictable or influenciable by foreing service.</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. “user vs state”: <small>Classical like “1” but with different target of interest, can be used neat area of economic or geographic conflicts.</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. “state vs state”: <small>The geopolitical, is like 2 but can be interpolated with current and past state level agreements or conflict </small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    5. “state vs organization”: <small>can be used to tackle companies, NGO or group that are explicitly threaten by a state actor.</small>
